**[Phiên bản tiếng Việt ở đây bạn nhé!](/about)**

Hi, I'm **Hoang Dang**, you can call me **Wilson**. My main job is Product Management for a tech company in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

I like coffee chat and listening to people's stories. Occasionally, I take on freelance or consulting projects. So, if you need a partner or just want to chat about 'Product-stories' or hobbies,... feel free to ping me. 👨🏻‍💻

# __So, what does this blog write about?__

Once, talking to an 'industry-bro', we suddenly realized that without working together (even working together), there is very little 'context' for Product guys to sit down and tell each other happy and sad stories about Product life. Besides, not telling, writing down is very easy to forget, so many hard-won experiences are swept away by the wind 🍃.

In an era where there are 5 content creators per square meter (lol) 😂 (they are all also very creative and professional), + many social & multi-media platforms, it is clear that people prefer 'surfing' videos on Tiktok, Youtube, ... or photos on Instagram rather than sitting down to read a page full of words like this.

So, I am not dreaming of big things. This blog is simply a place to write down what I know and experience in my work, the knowledge I gather from everywhere and apply, including miscellaneous things in my daily life. In simple terms, it is a wordier version of my Facebook. It's both to keep a record, to look back later, see how I have changed, and most importantly, to 'open the funnel', 'add touch points', have 'retro' & discuss with all of you to make everything more multidimensional. I also get to learn more, fix many bugs, continuously upgrade, and release newer, cooler versions of myself. 🙌🏻

# __'thedangw' - what does it mean?__

<br>
Actually, when choosing the name for my blog and domain registration, I had many options in mind - I'm sure anyone who has started a blog or created their own website, fan page, TikTok account, or personal Instagram,... has gone through or will go through the same process, researching about 8000 names. But either they weren't anything special, or the good ones were already taken. 🥲

→ But why bother perfecting it? The most important thing is product go-to-market, reaching the users, receiving feedback, and then improving, right? So, in short, the chosen one is: **thedangw** = the + Đăng (my name) + w (world, or with something/someone because I want all of you become a part of this blog). If there's something better, I'll update it later.

Say **'HI'** to the world: <b>thedangw</b> ✌🏻
