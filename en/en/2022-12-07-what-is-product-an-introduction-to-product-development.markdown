As mentioned in my **[bio](/about-eng)**, my main job is Product Management. For those of you working in the technology industry, this job may not be new or unfamiliar. However, for those outside the industry or those who are new and want to join, there may be many questions. In this article, you and I will explore what a product is and what Product Management is.

## What is a product?

Pause for a moment and look around. From the coffee cup on the table, the clothes you wear, the shoes you have on, or the phone/tablet/laptop you are holding, to the Google Chrome/Safari browser you are surfing or even this website itself, they are all products. So what is a product?

> Sản phẩm là bất kỳ vật phẩm vật lý (physical) hoặc kỹ thuật số (digital) nào được tạo ra hoặc thiết kế để đáp ứng nhu cầu hoặc giải quyết một vấn đề cho khách hàng.

As the example above shows, a product can be anything from food, clothing, household items, to complex applications, software such as macOS, Windows. A product can be tangible (you can touch, feel, and hold it) or intangible (a service or an experience package).

Within the scope of this article and blog, the products mentioned are software products and services in the field of information technology.

## What is Product Management?

Currently, there are many different definitions, perspectives, and schools of thought about Product Management in general and the Product position in particular. You can find out more from articles on platforms like Medium, or from large companies in the industry like Google, Facebook, etc.

#### The following content is my own perspective, which has been developed over nearly 10 years in the industry. For me, it is the foundation and continuous use throughout the work process, from building a career path, building a team, interviewing, evaluating,... Related articles later, if any, will be partly based on this perspective.

Creating a product involves a series of activities, including market research, product design, development, testing, operation, deployment,... to meet customer needs and promote business development. The entire process is called Product Management.

Based on the nature, skills, and stakeholders involved, Product Management can be divided into 3 parts:
- **Product Development / Build**
- **Product Operation**
- **Product Growth / Biz**

In the upcoming articles, I will explain in detail the nature of each part, as well as the necessary skills for working effectively in each phase.

## Who is a Product Owner? 

The person responsible for one or several stages is called a 'Product Guy'.

In Vietnam, there are many definitions of 'Product Guy'. Each company has a different job title and scope. Therefore, you need to carefully research the job description before applying. I often ask candidates how they understand the job and why they chose this direction before delving into their work experience.

Due to the influence of the widely applied Scrum / Agile model, I will use the term **'Product Owner / PO'** to refer to the 'Product Guy' in this article and in the future.
