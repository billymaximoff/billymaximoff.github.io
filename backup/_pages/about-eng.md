# __So, what does this blog write about?__

Once, talking to an 'industry brother', we suddenly realized that without working together (even working together), there is very little 'context' for Product guys to sit down and tell each other happy and sad stories about Product life. Besides, not telling, writing down is very easy to forget, so many hard-won experiences are swept away by the wind üçÉ.

In an era where there are 5 people creating content per square meter (lol) (they are all also very creative and professional), + many social & multi-media platforms, it is clear that people prefer 'eating' videos on Tiktok, Youtube, ... and looking at photos on Instagram rather than sitting down to read a page full of words like this.

So, I am not dreaming of big things. This page is simply a place to write down what I know and experience in my work, the knowledge I pick up from everywhere and apply, as well as the miscellaneous things in my daily life. It's both to remember and to look back later to see how I've changed, and most importantly, to exchange ideas with you to make everything more diverse. I can also learn more, fix more bugs, continuously upgrade, and release newer, more sophisticated versions of myself. I hope this page can help you to some extent. üôåüèª

# __'thedangw' - what does it mean?__

Actually, when choosing a blog name and domain to register, I thought of many options - probably anyone who started a blog or created a website, fanpage, Tik Tok, or Instagram account has done/researched like me, looking for 8,000 names (lol). But some are not interesting, and the interesting ones are ... already taken. ü•≤

At first, I chose **chillintheblank** because I like to... chill, chill with everything. As for the blank? When I was still in school, when taking English tests, you probably still remember a type of question that fills in the blank. At that time, we had to think to circle the 'most suitable' answer for the context that the sentence was referring to. Suddenly, I found it extremely suitable for me and my work - every day, I have to make choices that are not necessarily the best but the 'most suitable'.

That sounds good. But after testing a few cases, this name is too long and inconvenient when typing, printing, displaying or using as code... So in the end, the chosen name is: **thedangw** = the + Dang (my name) + w (world, or with something/someone, because I want all of you to be a part of this blog).

But why fuss over it? The most important product is the live version that reaches the users. Then we can receive feedback and improve, right? So in short: **thedangw**, there will be updates later.
